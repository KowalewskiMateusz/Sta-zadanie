This is a project made for intern in Profile Software company. I had to download and extract csv file and then make few things with extracted data. I used Python 3.7.2 (it won't work with Python 2). The requirement was to not use any external library(u can use it only for bonus tasks). 
If i were to use external libraries i would use Pandas to be precis I would use data_frame structur to handle data.
I had to write unit tests to this program as well. Today I learned that writing first tests and later code(TDD) is way better than first writing code and then tests. So I will definitly do this in my next project. If i were to write full test module i would have to rewrite all my main program because I had no idea how to make tests to program i have now. Normally I would just do that but I right now I lack time to do this.

If u want to run a program u will need few things:
1.Python 3.7.2 u can download it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/. The instruction how to do this is on site too.
2.U will also need pip to download pandas,requests packages. First u will need to install pip from here https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. And second u will need to install these 3 packages with pip(pip install requests,pip install pandas)
3.After that just find the catalog with the program and print "python Main.py".
